## About Me! ðŸ’¬

I am Subhodeep Sarkar, the founder of Py-Volution, a non-profit organization, aimed at teaching Python programming, version control systems like Git and Github, and some of the other computer science topics to people ALL OVER THE WORLD who are interested in the field of computer science and information technology but are either not from a computer science background, or with monetary issues, or have work pressure or any other problems. Py-Volution aims to promote the field of computer science by eradicating the lack of confidence from the minds of people. I believe, the world can have great potentials but out youth lack technical training either because they are unable to afford expensive formal college degrees, or costly courses or hiring a professional tutor or simply because they think they must be from a CS background to excel in the field of IT.
I am a Python developer, competitive programmer, web developer, network engineer, Linux lover, and ethical hacker. I have completed many certifications from renowned organizations such as Google, Cisco, The Linux Foundation, and the University of Michigan. I have Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate, Cisco Certified Network Associate Professional Certificate, Python for Everybody Specialization, Open Source Software Development Linux and Git Specialization, and many other minor technical courses.
Talking about my top skills, first on the list comes Python programming, then network administration, Google Cloud Platform, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM), Bash. Along with these technical skills, I have few but notable skills, like typing at a speed of 80-100 WPM, teaching, mentoring, marketing, and great communication skills.  
I am familiar and well-versed with GNU/Linux OS and AWS Cloud, and when it comes to programming, I have a working knowledge of C, C++, and Java. I am planning to learn Cython, Nim, Golang, and Rust shortly.
